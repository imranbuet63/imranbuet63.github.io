  Hi Everyone, I am Imran Khan and I am from Bangladesh. Currently, I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering at Northeastern University. Before that, I completed my master's in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Southern Illinois University Carbondale (2020) and I earned my Bachelor of Science in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). Currently, I am working as a Research Assistant in NUWiNS Lab under the supervision of Dr. Dimitrios Koutsonikolas. My research interest involves ensuring end-to-end performance, mobility, and reliablity in 5G/6G networks.

          I am part of NuWINS lab and also affiliated with the Northeastern Institure for the Wireless Internet of Things (WIoT). As part of the WIoT I am involved in developing next generation cellular networks/testbeds. Besides, my other projects involve ensuring end to end performance, mobility, reliability and consistency of performance of mmWave cellular in current 5G.
